--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--1.) How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
select count(distinct orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 2.) How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
select count(distinct orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'IPhone' 
and length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--3.) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
select distinct acctnum
from BIT_DB.customers as cust
inner join BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
on cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4.) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select distinct Product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where price in (select min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales);

-- Second Method
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--5.) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity)* price as revenue, product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;

--6.) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select sum(quantity),product, sum(quantity)* price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product;

--7.) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
left join BIT_DB.customers as cust
on Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
where feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--8.) List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
select Product, sum(Quantity)
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location like '%Los Angeles%'
group by product;


--Part 2.

--1.)Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
select distinct location, orderID
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where location like '%NY%'
and length (orderID) = 6
and orderID <> 'OrderID'
group by location
having count (orderID) > 2;

--2.)How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
select distinct product, sum(quantity) as quantity
from BIT_DB.FebSales 
where product like '%Headphones%'
group by product;

--3.)What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
select avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
left join BIT_DB.customers cust
on FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
where length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid <> 'Order ID'

--4.)What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
select sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
from BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
left join BIT_DB.customers cust
on FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
where length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid <> 'Order ID'

--5.)Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
select product, sum(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product
order by sum(quantity*price) desc
limit 1;
