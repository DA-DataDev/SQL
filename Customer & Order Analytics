--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--1.) How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
select count(distinct orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- 2.) How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
select count(distinct orderid)
from BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'IPhone' 
and length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--3.) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
select distinct acctnum
from BIT_DB.customers as cust
inner join BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
on cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4.) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select distinct Product, price
from BIT_DB.JanSales
where price in (select min(price) from BIT_DB.JanSales);

-- Second Method
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

--5.) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity)* price as revenue, product
from BIT_DB.JanSales
group by product;

--6.) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select sum(quantity),product, sum(quantity)* price as revenue
from BIT_DB.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by product;

--7.) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
from BIT_DB.FebSales as Feb
left join BIT_DB.customers as cust
on Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
where feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
